# Purpose of this project

In this course you will learn to build a web application without frameworks or unnecessary libraries, but with vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript as much as possible. The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA). Data will be retrieved from an external API of your choice, manipulated and finally shown in the UI of the App. You will learn different ways to structure code and develop your own coding style. With the gained knowledge you will be able to build interactive prototypes, based on real data. Also you will gain a better understanding of how API's, frameworks and libraries work.

# Concept

This application displays a new Astronomy Picture of the Day. These are pictures that NASA chooses each day. You also have the option to choose a date or a period. This application will then show you the picture of the day od that date, or the pictures of the day from each day within the given period.

# API

This application uses the NASA Astronomy Picture Of the DAY (APOD) API.
